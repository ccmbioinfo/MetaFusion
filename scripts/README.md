# pygenefusionann
gene fusion annotation tool by python

1. Load bed format gene annotation
2. map given genomic locations to genes
3. left realign fusion breakpoints
4. compare cff gene fusions
5. generate fusion stats:
  a. common by samples
  b. common by tools
  c. Category fusions (e.g. by tumor/normal, genefusion/readthrough) and count fusion numbers
